			<b> Terms And Conditions :</b> <br>
			<p>In order to become an active member of ShareBazar.com and gain
				access to the services provided, you need to pay an amount of Rs.
				1000. On successful registration, you are provided a Custom rid.</p>
			<br>
			 <b> Encryption  :</b> <br>
			<p>The encryption - electronic scrambling is used to convert your
				personal account details into secret code which is then sent over
				the Internet. The worst security gap online is you. Many customers
				still use passwords that are obvious or easily guessable. Your date
				of birth, name or partner's name just will not do. If an application
				asks you to create a password choose a combination of letters and
				numbers, which is difficult to guess.</p>
