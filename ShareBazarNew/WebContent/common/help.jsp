			<b>Online share dealing: How it works</b>
			<p>Online share dealing means that thousands of investors can
				have the information about the stock market from their computer.</p>
			<br> <b> This has two main advantages:</b>
			<ul>
				<li>You can buy and sell in real time, which means that you
					know the exact price at which you are dealing. You want to buy or
					sell at the given price.</li>
				<li>You may be able to deal on the same terms as the giant
					investment institutions* - and so get a better price. The brokers
					can bundle together trades from many small investors to deal at the
					best rate available. Internet share dealing is just beginning to
					take off in India, but it looks as though it will start to follow
					American trends. The growth in web trade has also prompted the
					birth of the first 'born on the net' broker E*Trade. Unlike its
					Internet competitors, it has no telephone broking arm - all its
					customers use the Internet.</li>

			</ul>
			Online dealing is execution only. This means the broker acts only on
			your instructions. There is no financial advice about what to buy and
			sell.
			<p>
				<b> How it works</b>
			</p>
			<p>Online brokers require you to set up an account with them.On
				some sites your password will also allow you to access broker
				information supplied to clients. For example, you can access market
				information and share tips.</p>
			<p>You ask for online dealing prices for the shares you want to
				buyer or  The money to pay for the shares will either be taken from
				your account or charged to your debit/credit card as appropriate.
				Once settlement occurs, the share certificates are sent by email.</p>
